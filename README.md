### In order to compile this project, it is required to include SDL2 directory in Visual Studio. To do so:
1. Open VC++ Directories tab in Project->Properties.
2. In Include Directories choose option Edit, then in the most-upper window add path to SDL2\include.
3. Add path SDL2\lib\x86 OR SDL2\lib\x64 (depending on chosen solution platform in your VS) to the Library Directories in the same fashion as previously.
4. In Linker tab, under Additional Library Directories it is required to add the same path as in point 3.
5. Lastly, it is needed to have SDL2.dll file in the same folder as solution file.
